Technical Structure of Project.

Zephyr was used in place of Llama 2 as it delivers higher performance with a similar footprint.

Different sentiment analysis models were explored, such as KNN as Zephyr itself; Bert-uncased was chosen as it offered high accuracy with low memory consumption.

## Future Improvements
Potential improvements which were not explored due to time commitment limitations.

- RAG to provide domain-specific context to chat bot
- Using web scraping to deliver context on a specific product page
- Fine tuning the chat model to deliver higher quality responses
